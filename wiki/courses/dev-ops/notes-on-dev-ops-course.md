# Intro

This graffiti board is for capturing unstructured, informal notes that will be cleaned up later and made into real notes & docs.

These notes are related to dev ops.  Specifically, preparing for creating course on dev ops.  But could serve as source material for blog posts, wiki pages, articles, etc.

Anything related to DevOps jot down here.
